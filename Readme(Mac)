This a MPW MrC (PPC) binary build of Math-FFT-0.25 for Macperl 5.6.1. Passed all tests
If you encounter a problem and/or bugs feel free to contact me.


Caveats 
-------

This package contains shared libraries, which are loaded dynamically by MacPerl -- 
well, normally. Currently, dynamic loading of shared libs may *not* work with the MPW 
MacPerl tool. However, dynamic loading reliably works with the MacPerl application.
Note also that dynamic loading is NOT supported by the 68K versions of the MacPerl 
application and tool. And finally, note that this module will *not* work with 
the older MacPerl 5.2.0r4.

This module also will *not* work with MacPerl 5.8.0
